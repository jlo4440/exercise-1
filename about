        <br>My favorite color is teal. I have a completely rational fear of semi-trucks. I am the oldest of five children. I am 5'2", generously 5'3". My favorite television shows include Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Community, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Friends. My favorite movies include, but are not limited to, Love Actually and In Bruges. My favorite superhero is Spider-Man and I prefer the Andrew Garfield portrayal over Tobey MacGuire. Sorry. My favorite Disney movie is Hercules, which is ironically the only one I don't own--I always borrow it from the public library. Like loads of times. If I could be any celebrity for a day, I would probably embody Beyonce, because she's a goddess, or Air Bud, because I've always wanted to be a dog that could play basketball. If I could have any kind of pet, it would probably be a rat, or two. I'd name them Pepe Silvia and Terence Peterson. If I get a dog, I'd adopt one and name him Parker. I never want to get married or have kids. Instead, my goal in life is to attain Pepe Silvia, Terence Peterson and Parker and spend my days both contributing to the animation of movies and watching them on Netflix. I suppose I should mention that I am a freshman at Bradley University currently studying Interactive Media with a concentration in Animation and Visual Effects. I used to have two fish until the bigger one killed the littler one. Interestingly enough, the bigger fish has a Hitler moustache.
